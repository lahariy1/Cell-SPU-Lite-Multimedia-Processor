# Cell-SPU-Lite-Multimedia-Processor
Devised a cycle-accurate dual-issue 11-stage pipelined model of a Cell SPU lite processing core and defined an
instruction set comprising 90 assembly instructions. Created and tested the System Verilog model of the processing core, which includes fetch modules, decode modules,
data forwarding circuits, two pipes with multiple pipelined processing units, and local memory. Implemented hazard detection and mitigation techniques for data, control, and structural hazards in the design. Composed a parser algorithm to convert assembly code to binary code for input to the Super scalar processor core.
