Test case numbers and the conditions that they check:								
2) Ins1 having raw and Ins2 not haz(stalling and forwarding)		
4) Ins2 having Struct and Ins1 no haz										
6) Ins2 has raw and waw or struct haz previously and Ins1 no haz	
11) Ins1 having raw (forwarding, not stall)								
13) Control hazard, branch absolute( inst2 is branch) and  PC is even							
14) Control hazard, branch absolute( inst1 is branch) and PC is even							
15) Control hazard, branch absolute( inst2 is branch) and PC is odd							
16) Control hazard, branch absolute( inst1 is branch) and PC is odd							
17) Control hazard, branch absolute(inst1 is branch, ins2 is odd pipe)							
19) Control hazard, branch if not zero( inst2 is branch) and  PC is even - not taken
20)Control hazard, branch absolute(inst1 is branch, ins2 is even pipe)
